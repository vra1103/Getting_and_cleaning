1. Download, unzip the dataset.
save the zip file as week4_dataset.zip
extract the zip file to the folder UCI HAR Dataset 

2. Read the dataset
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns (contains the feature vector from the accelerometer and gyroscope)
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns (contains the class labels with their activity name)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column (contains the id of the test subjects being observed)
X_train <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns (contains test set)
y_train <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns (contains test labels)
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column (contains the id of the train subjects being observed)
XMTT <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns (contains train set)
YMTT <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns (contains train labels)

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test with rbind()
Mergedata (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X with cbind()

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by selecting columns with the mean and std meansurement, along with the class label and subject id

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
TidyData$code  replace the Tidycode with its acitivity name Tidy activities

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
replace the column name with a more descriptive name
All Acc -> Accelerometer
All Gyro -> Gyroscope
All Mag -> Magnitude
All f -> Freq
All t -> Time
and so on

7. From the data set in step 6, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData  180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyDf by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
FinalData is is exported to FinalData.txt
