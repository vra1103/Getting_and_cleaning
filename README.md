# Getting_and_cleaning
Getting and Cleaning data assignment (Week 4)
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is my submission for the peer graded assignment in the course Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Project Description:
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

An R script `run_analysis.R` was created to do the following:

Download, unzip the dataset.
Read the dataset
Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 6, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
